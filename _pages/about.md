I'm Jierui Li, a Ph.D. student at computer science department, University of Texas at Austin, advised by [Prof. Raymond Mooney](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/). I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. 



I'm interested in many topics in natural language processing, including math word problems, interpretability, machine translation and schema learning.



Education
------
**University of Electronic Science and Technology of China**  
Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology  
*Sep 2016 ~ Jun 2020*

**University of Texas at Austin**  
Ph.D. Student in Computer Science  
*Sep 2021 ~ present*



## Experience

**Center for Future Media** @UESTC  
Student 				*Oct 2018 - Jun 2019*  
Math Word Problems: Work on one specific task with different methods. My main interest and focus are exploring neural networks for reasoning with math word problems as a window.

**Tencent AI Lab** @Shenzhen  
Research Intern			*Sep 2019 - Jun 2020*  
Research Intern at Tencent AI Lab, NLP center, supervised by [Dr. Lemao Liu](https://lemaoliu.github.io/homepage/).  
Evaluating Explanation Methods for NMT: We propose a simulating-based automatic evaluation method to evaluate explanation methods for Neural Machine Translation.  Attention's Interpretability: Follow a series of works to analyze the interpretability of attention mechanism and discuss the seemingly contradictory conclusions presented in previous papers.

**SUTD StatNLP Lab** @Singapore  
Research Assistant		 *Jan 2021 - Aug 2021*  
Research Assistant supervised by [Prof. Wei Lu](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei), at Singapore University of Technology and Design.
Structured Math Word Problem Solving: I am working on a project where we propose a parser to parse math word problems into specially structured formulations.
